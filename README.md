# World-Sweeper
### Online Multiplayer Minesweeper

## Minesweeper in 20XX?
I believe minesweeper has potential to be fun even today. Traditionally it is a very bare-bones experience, but it doesn't have to be that way.

This project grew out of a 2-Day hackathon type project I made that was essentially just multiple players sharing the same minesweeper board online. It had a great reception among my peers and I felt the idea still had untapped potential.

## Where to play
Unfortunately, the project is still in what might be considered pre-alpha stage, but as soon as it is playable I will host test servers.
